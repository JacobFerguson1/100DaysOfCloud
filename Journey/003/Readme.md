# Create IAM Users, Groups, add MFA, and attach Policies

## Cloud Research

- ✍️ For day 3 of #100daysofcloud I go over how to create IAM users and groups and attach policies to these users and groups.

I show how to delete a policy from a particular user and attach it to the group instead.

I go over how to set up MFA for your AWS account and explain that you should never sign into your account with a username and password only.
